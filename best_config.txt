These are the best configurations and approaches that have minimized the cost and violations:

1. Hyperparameters: 

const int POPULATION_SIZE = 8000, NUM_ITER = 120000, CONVERGENCE_STOPPING_CRITERION = 100, NURSE_SKILL_LEVEL_ALLOWANCE = 3, NURSE_MAX_LOAD_ALLOWANCE = 3;
const float p_m = 5e-2f, THREASHOLD = 1000; // the maximum violation and cost of the chromosomes after normalization (inter/extra-polation)
float upper_bound = 0.9, lower_bound = 0.2, p_c = 0.8;

2. Approaches:

a. After every operation (crossover or mutation), duing Elitism, we are including the offsprings in the population only if:
	i. It reduces the Violations and the fitness. If violations are equal
	ii. If it improves the fitness but the violations are more, we reject it straightaway.
	iii. If both the offsprings after crossover are better (in terms of violations and then fitness), we select both of them.
	iv. If either offspring is better than both the worst and second_worst chromosomes, we replace both this new offspring with both of them - increasing the 
	number of same "good" chromosomes in the population. 

	v. Trying - Adaptive Allowances on the basis of the number of patients: Lower number of patients will have lower allowance, higher number of patients will 
	have higher allowance.


3. Allowances tuning: 

1.
num_p < 50 : 1, 1
num_p < 100 : 3, 3
num_p < 300 : 7, 7
num_p > 300 : 9, 9

2. 
num_p < 50 : 1, 1
num_p < 100 : 3, 3
num_p < 300 : 3, 5
num_p < 700 : 3, 5
num_p > 700 : 4, 7
